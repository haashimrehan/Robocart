# Robocart
During my summer co-op between grades 11 and 12 in 2019, I developed an autonomous guided vehicle for indoor deliveries. This Arduino-controlled robot featured obstacle detection sensors and line following algorithms. There is even a neat feature where if the line the robot is following is blocked for too long, the robot switches to the line beside it automatically. The project combined my high school robotics experience with my programming skills, demonstrating my ability to apply classroom knowledge to practical automation challenges.
